Remember that you can also always free up space by axing things you don't care about
removing record mixing secret bases (which no one even remembers exist!) gives you like 2400 bytes or some shit
Look for SECRET_BASES_COUNT  I believe and just drop it to 1
You could drop it to 0 but you might need to tweak some more code to account for it, and this is the lazy mf's way of freeing up save space
